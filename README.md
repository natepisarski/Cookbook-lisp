# Cookbook-lisp
Cookbook-lisp is the Lisp port of the Cookbook library. It has always been a part of it, along with the (now deprecated in favor of D) staging C port. This repository is the new home, rather than the nested directory within Cookbook called PORTS.

To use Cookbook-lisp in your project, get the libraries into your load-path and include Cookook.lisp; it sets up the package names using the short name convention from Cookbook-hs.
