# Cookbook: Lisp
Partial port of the [Cookbook general library](https://github.com/natepisarski/Cookbook-hs/) to Lisp. Mostly an educational exercise in learning Lisp, but can obviously be used in real projects.

This doesn't contain any of the "advanced" parts of Cookbook like the **Project** or **Recipes** branch, but has the basic functions.
